# APItestingPostman
I used postman for manual testing of api as well as automate the api in postman.
It is the collection of various api in postman.
here i posted a post api, put api, patch api, get api and run all these api with collection runner.
I also add the data driven testing done in postman by excel sheet as well as by json.
I also add the soap api as well as request chaining done on post api.
I here used the Dynamic variable to get the different responses, for that i use the fakers library.
